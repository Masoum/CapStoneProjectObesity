The Dataset is Obesity CSV file located in Data folder which was downloaded from :
https://www.kaggle.com/code/mpwolke/obesity-levels-life-style

It includes data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition.
The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the Obesity Level, 
that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III.

In the capstone project I tried to answer the questions below:

Does calorie counting (SCC) affect obesity levels?
Does a family history of obesity affect a person's obesity level?
How is obesity distributed across the population?
Do men and women have different obesity levels?
What is the average age of people in each obesity category?
What is the age distribution of obese people?
Does physical activity (FAF) correlate with obesity?
